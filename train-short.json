Unfortunately they did not email nor did I have a message on my phone from them, so I just wasted the entire last 24 hours scrambling around and spent the rest of my money getting prepped for an interview I showed up for and didn't even fucking get.\n\nPizza may in fact be the only thing that satisfies my vindictive rage at this point. Moreso I'm just really, really hungry and haven't been able to eat well lately. The friends I'm staying with give me a bite here and there, but they're very low income with 3 kids and I try to avoid it at all costs. Would seriously appreciate it, and pay it forward!",

Finally get a lead, two phone interviews, and an interview scheduled for today. I get in there, and the HR manager explains that they \"Tried to reach me yesterday\" to tell me not to come in. Unfortunately they did not email nor did I have a message on my phone from them, so I just wasted the entire last 24 hours scrambling around and spent the rest of my money getting prepped for an interview I showed up for and didn't even fucking get.\n\nPizza may in fact be the only thing that satisfies my vindictive rage at this point.

I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.  \n\nIn exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.  I could do a brooch or a pendant with seed beads, crystal, felt, some semi precious gem beads I have here.  You could tell me what colors you like and I could make something for you or a loved one.  I am open to suggestions.

I'm down to 5 packets of ramen, but new funds come in on the 5th so I really just would like to get through this weekend and also feel a bit less depressed while job hunting and lesson planning.  If you could please send me a pizza, it would make my night!\n\nThank you.  Hopefully someday soon I'll be the one sending out the pizza.",
