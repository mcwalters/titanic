Titanic from Kaggle based on tutorial by Trevor Stephens at <http://trevorstephens.com/post/72916401642/titanic-getting-started-with-r>

Here's how to get CSV files into data frames in R.
```{r}
train <- read.csv("~/Projects/titanic/train.csv")
test <- read.csv("~/Projects/titanic/test.csv")
```


Let's have a look, and do some basic descriptive functions.
```{r}
str(train)
table(train$Survived)
prop.table(table(train$Survived))
```


Let's try killing everyone! And then output it to CSV for submission to Kaggle.

```{r}
test$Survived <- rep(0, dim(test)[1])  # dim[1] is number of rows, rep repeats value for number of times.

submit <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = test$Survived)
write.csv(submit, file = "theyallperish.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

But that's no good. So let's look at some other stuff...

```{r}
summary(train$Sex)

```



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
