Titanic from Kaggle based on tutorial by Trevor Stephens at <http://trevorstephens.com/post/72916401642/titanic-getting-started-with-r>

Here's how to get CSV files into data frames in R.
```{r}
train <- read.csv("~/Projects/titanic/train.csv")
test <- read.csv("~/Projects/titanic/test.csv")
```


Let's have a look, and do some basic descriptive functions.
```{r}
str(train)
table(train$Survived)
prop.table(table(train$Survived))
```


Let's try killing everyone! And then output it to CSV for submission to Kaggle.

```{r}
test$Survived <- rep(0, dim(test)[1])  # dim[1] is number of rows, rep repeats value for number of times.

submit <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = test$Survived)
write.csv(submit, file = "theyallperish.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

But that's no good. So let's look at some other stuff...like gender.

```{r}
summary(train$Sex)
prop.table(table(train$Sex, train$Survived))
prop.table(table(train$Sex, train$Survived),1)  #second argument is axis to group on, in this case: 1st = rows.
test$Survived <- 0
test$Survived[test$Sex == 'female'] <- 1
```

Better... Now with Ages.

```{r}
summary(train$Age)
train$Child <- 0
train$Child[train$Age < 18] <- 1
aggregate(Survived ~ Child + Sex, data=train, FUN=sum)
aggregate(Survived ~ Child + Sex, data=train, FUN=length)
 aggregate(Survived ~ Child + Sex, data=train, FUN=function(x) {sum(x)/length(x)})

```

And Money:
```{r}
train$Fare2 <- '30+'
train$Fare2[train$Fare < 30 & train$Fare >= 20] <- '20-30'
train$Fare2[train$Fare < 20 & train$Fare >= 10] <- '10-20'
train$Fare2[train$Fare < 10] <- '<10'
aggregate(Survived ~ Fare2 + Pclass + Sex, data=train, FUN=function(x) {sum(x)/length(x)})

test$Survived <- 0
test$Survived[test$Sex == 'female'] <- 1
test$Survived[test$Sex == 'female' & test$Pclass == 3 & test$Fare >= 20] <- 0
```



```{r}
library('rpart')

fit <- rpart(Survived ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked, data=train, method="class")
library("RColorBrewer", lib.loc="~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2")
library("rattle", lib.loc="~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2")
library("rpart.plot", lib.loc="~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.2")

fancyRpartPlot(fit)


```

You can also embed plots, for example:


```{r}
Prediction <- predict(fit, test, type = "class")

submit <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = Prediction)

write.csv(submit, file = "myfirstdtree.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```




So, I'm liking Rstudio almost more than jupyter notebook.
This is amazing!

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
